#My web my Responsibility #

An small server write to support privacy and data ownership.

###Why?

I dont like to continue using company services unless they become compromissed with my privacy. It means dont use my data to provide targeting for ad's, for instance.

###How?

provide alternative services to the products I am used to.


###What?

An user friendly personal server, easy to configure and deploy.
In fact deploy as unikernel is my goal(that's why "an small server")


First Goals:

- Blog

- File

- music stream
